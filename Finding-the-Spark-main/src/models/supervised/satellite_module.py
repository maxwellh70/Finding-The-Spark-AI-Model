        Note: CrossEntropyLoss requires mask to be of type
        torch.int64 and shape (batches, width, height), 
        it only has one channel as the label is encoded as

        torch.reshape or torch.squeeze in order to remove the
        extraneous dimensions, as well as using Tensor.to to
        cast the tensor to the correct type.

        Note: The type of the tensor input to the neural network
        must be the same as the weights of the neural network.
        Most often than not, the default is torch.float32, so
